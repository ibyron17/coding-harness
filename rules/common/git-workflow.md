# Git Workflow

## Commit Message Format
```
<type>: <description>

<optional body>
```

Types: feat, fix, refactor, docs, test, chore, perf, ci

### Message style

- Write so a non-developer can understand it: plain words, no unexplained jargon,
  no raw identifier or symbol names, no cryptic abbreviations.
- Keep it short and direct (단답형). Prefer a single line; add a body only when the
  change genuinely needs context — a few plain sentences, not paragraphs.

Note: To disable co-author attribution on commits, set `"includeCoAuthoredBy": false` in `~/.claude/settings.json` (Claude Code appends `Co-Authored-By` by default; ECC does not ship this setting).

## Pull Request Workflow

When creating PRs:
1. Analyze full commit history (not just latest commit)
2. Use `git diff [base-branch]...HEAD` to see all changes
3. Draft comprehensive PR summary
4. Include test plan with TODOs
5. Push with `-u` flag if new branch
